Description from itch.io page:
After decades of meddling where no other man dare tread, the hubris-wrought debt has at last come due. Aberrations from beyond this plane are at the gates, and the only things stopping them from emerging into your world are you, a few tattered stubs of chalk, and the sigils you risked it all to learn.

Using the scraps from your fell grimoire, create seals powerful enough to stop each aberration as it appears.

Controls:
WASD - Navigate
SHIFT - Rotate Sigil
SPACE - Select
E - Back/Finish
